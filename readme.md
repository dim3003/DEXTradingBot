# Polygon DEX Trading Bot

The Polygon DEX Trading Bot is a comprehensive tool designed for executing efficient trading strategies on the Polygon network. The aim of this project is to streamline the trading process, enhance the profitability of trades, and provide users with an in-depth analysis of different strategies.
Overview

This project consists of three main modules:

### 1. Data Fetcher (dataFetcher.py)

This module retrieves closing price data from Binance. With this data, users can analyze market trends, predict future price movements, and decide the most appropriate trading strategies.

###Â 2. Strategy Analyzer (strategyAnalyzer.py)

The Strategy Analyzer evaluates each trading strategy stored in a DataFrame. By comparing various trading strategies, it helps users understand their potential outcomes, risks, and rewards, thereby assisting them in choosing the most suitable trading strategies.

### 3. Trading Bot (bot.py)

The Trading Bot is responsible for executing trades on the chain. It sends orders to the Polygon network based on the decisions made during the strategy analysis process, aiming to maximize profitability while managing risks.
